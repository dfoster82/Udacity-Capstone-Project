# Tracking the Vespertilionidae Family of Bats

## Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project

### Project Summary

I am interested in biology and zoology, so rather than work on the Udacity-provided data sets, I wanted to research data sets on my own to design a project that held some personal interest. I started by deciding that I wanted to learn more about how bats (specifically those in the Vespertilionidae family) are tracked for scientific studies and then researched data sets that would provide this information as well as more general data about these bats as a species.

I imagined if I were a wildlife biologist or scientist, I might want to be able to quickly determine which species are being studied and tracked. I wanted to gather and combine the data sets I chose to show if any species that are listed in the GBIF occurrence data are included in any tracking studies. I used Amazon S3 to store the data and Amazon Redshift to design the database.

I analyzed three primary sets of data:

* GBIF occurrence data
* Movebank data
* List of vernacular (common) names
